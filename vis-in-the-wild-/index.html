			This is the data which records the COVID-19 cases in the Iceland from June to August in 2020. For each chart, the x-axis represent the date and y-axis represent the quantity according to content of each chart. <br>
			<address> <a href="https://www.covid.is/data">Covid.Iceland</a> is a link to the dataset provided by Directorate of Health and The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Managment.</address>

			<h4>Incidence per 100000 inhabitants</h4>

			In the line chart figure, it records incidences from Jun 30 to August 26 per 100000 inhabitants. They are either from <strong>Domestic infections</strong> or <strong>border screening</strong> case. These two differnt situations represent as two linear discriminant line with different colors. We can see most of incidences are caused by domestic infections. Both are increasing as time goes on. 
			</p>


			<hr>
			<h4>Number of domestic infections and those who have finished isolation</h4>

			<p>
			This histogram represent the number of domestic infections and those who have finished isolation or isolating now.
			</p>


			<hr>
			<h4>Percentage of infected persons who were diagnosed while in quarantine</h4>
			<img src="imgs/diagnosed.png" alt="Percentage of infected persons who were diagnosed while in quarantine">
			<hr>
			<p>
			This historgram shows the 57% of infected persons who were diagnosed were in quarantine. There are three colors show in this historgram, blue represent as in <strong>quanrantine at the diagnosis</strong>, orange represent <strong>not in quarantine at the time of diagnosis</strong>, grey means <strong>no infections</strong> in that day.
			</p>


			<hr>
			<h4>Number of infectors in isolation by age</h4>
			<img src="imgs/age.png" alt="Number of infectors in isolation by age">
			<hr>
			<p>
			The last historgram shows number of infectors in isolation by age,the age range is from 1 to 89 years old. According to this figure, we know that most of infectors' age is around <strong>30 years old</strong> in Iceland
			</p>
			<hr>

			<p>
			This four figures shows the current COVID-19 infectors' information from <strong>June to August</strong> in 2020, including the identity,age and diagnosis of infectors. One figure represent data as <strong>line chart</strong> and others as <strong>histograms</strong>. There are different objects show in each figure, each figure has labels with different colors for different objects.
			</p>

			<p>
			 I really like this visualization becasue it uses blue and orange colors to label different object in each figure. They make information very clear for users to extract, furthermore, line chart also help users to see the <strong>trendency of data</strong>. Histograms also help users to figure out the <strong>min and max</strong> value in the figure. Furthemore, the user of these visulizations could be local people who live in Iceland, these visualizations give them a clear trendency of COVID-19 cases as times going on, then local people can prepare protective measures for personal safety.
			</p>

			<p>
			 Moreover, the data can be used to do the data mining research since they record very detail information of infectors, researchers can find relationship between different data which this website provided. Thus, the target user could be medical data scientist, this kind of data help target users work more efficiency, it saves scientists' time to work on the data. It also supports <strong>"computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively."</strong> statment.
